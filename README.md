# reddit_compare
Compare different subreddits subscribers growths.

Make sure you have these modules installed: 
  plotly.offline
  plotly.graph_objs
  datetime
  urllib
  
Run Types_of_graph in command line or your IDE and follow through with the inputs. 

This program works by scraping data off redditmetrics, so if redditmetrics is down, unfortunately, the program won't be able to generate 
any graphs. 

Have fun!

(I made this program a while ago, and there are some methods in the program which I don't include in the user input section. Mostly because I don't remember what the real purpose of these other graph methods are. If you'd like to figure it out for yourself, I've left them commented out above the input section.)
